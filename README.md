# 🎥 **IoT-Based Wild Animal Alert System – Unity Animation**  

This repository contains an **animation video** developed in **Unity**, using assets sourced from **Sketchfab**. The animation demonstrates an **IoT-based alert system** designed to detect and warn villagers about wild animals crossing into human settlements.  

📌 **This project was submitted by me for the IoT Domain Team participating in Taylor’s University *Make A Difference (MAD) Enterprise Program*.**  

## 🔹 **Project Overview**  
- **Engine:** Unity (2021+ recommended)  
- **Animation System:** Animator & Timeline  
- **Assets Source:** Sketchfab (3D models & textures)
- **Language**: C#
- **Output Format:** MP4 video exported from Unity  
- **Domain:** IoT-Based Smart Alert System for Wildlife Movement  

## 🔹 **Concept & Workflow**  
### **1. Problem Statement**  
Wild animals straying into villages pose a **threat to both human and animal safety**. This animation visualizes an **IoT-based early warning system** that detects animal movement and triggers alerts.  

### **2. Animation Flow in Unity**  
1. **3D Environment Setup**  
   - Terrain designed to resemble a **village near a forest**.  
   - Imported **wild animal models (elephants)** and domestic animal like cow  from Sketchfab.  

2. **IoT System Representation**  
   - **Smart Motion Sensors** (represented visually) detect animal movement.  
   - **Signal Transmission to Alert System** (via simulated data flow).  

3. **Alert Mechanism**  
   - IoT system triggers  and audio sirens**.  
   

4. **Realistic Animation**  
   - **Animal movement simulated using Unity Animator**.  
   - **Camera transitions and Timeline sequencing** for smooth storytelling.  

5. **Lighting & Post-Processing**  
   - Real-time lighting to enhance visibility.  
   - Post-processing effects like **Bloom and Depth of Field** for realism.  

6. **Rendering & Export**  
   - Captured the final animation using **Unity Recorder**.  
   - Exported as an **MP4 file** for submission.  



This animation serves as a **visual proof of concept** for using **IoT and AI-driven monitoring systems** to prevent human-wildlife conflicts. 🌍🐾
